## General Buying Questions

### Difference between a proxy and a forwarder?
Both of these options offer the same end result, buying a (normally) Japanese product and getting it imported into your country. The process of "who buys the thing" is the largest difference and is explained for each below.
#### Proxy
A proxy is a simpler experience, usually at a slight increased cost. You find a Japanese product you would like to purchase, you send them the link and the money through some form on their site, and either automatically through a bot, or manually by a human, the item will get bought and sent to their warehouse. They'll keep you updated during the process and tell you once it's arrived at their warehouse. From there, you'll need to pay an additional shipping fee to get shipped internationally (and potentially customs depending on your country and value of the item). Some popular proxies have excellent support for common sites and will let you add to the proxy cart in a single click. In summary, you give them a link and money, they buy the thing on your behalf, ship to themselves, and then ship to you.
#### Forwarder
A forwarder will give you more options in terms of availability but at an increased amount of work for the user. Starting with similar scenario, you find a Japanese product you like but you proceed with making an account on that site. Assuming you have the forwarder account, you will have a forwarding address somewhere on the site or your profile. On the purchasing site, when you go to purchase, you would use that forwarding address instead of your own. Eventually, the item will make its way to that forwarding address, at which point they will alert you. This is where proxies and forwarders are most similar, since you'll have to also pay for international shipping here like a proxy. If an item is predicted to be sold out extremely quickly, this will be the preferred method since you are in control of the buying because manual proxies will tend to have a large lag on purchasing at a certain time.

### List of proxies
We mention some in the [fumo buying page](/posts/buying/#recommended-proxies) but that's not an exhaustive list.

### What is Suruga-ya, Lashinbang, Mercari, etc
We mention the well-known ones in the [fumo buying page](/posts/buying/#secondhand--bootleg-fumo-sellers).

### What is VAT or Customs Tax?
Slightly different things but both are extra fees you may have to pay on your packages or your country will be angry at you.
Outside the EU, VAT isn't something to worry about, but for our EU friends you'll have to pay about 19% VAT (and sometimes an additional flat fee to the delivery company).

Customs/duties tax is for any country that you're importing a product from outside. This will vary wildly and most countries have a minimum limit before having this applied, so this may not count for you. Most will also have differing percents but the important thing below is at what price point do you generally have to consider paying these fees?

Below is a table for some common countries for your reference, note this may be outdated [Last updated 2024-03-21]
The minimum values for customs have been pulled from [Global Express](https://global-express.org/index.php?id=271&act=101&profile_id=-1&countries%5B%5D=-2&search_terms=&question-filter=&qid_34=1&qid_34_optid=1&qid_35=1&qid_36=1&qid_92=1). Customs & Duties are used interchangeably below but they're technically different. If you need a more exact number, look up your country's information.

| Country | Customs (starting value) | VAT |
| ---------------------- | ------- | --- |
| United States [US] | 800 USD | No |
| Germany [DE] | 150 EUR | 19%, 6-16 EUR to delivery company |
| France [FR] | 150 EUR | 19% |
| Canada [CA] | 20 CAD | No |
| United Kingdom [UK] | 135 GBP | No |
| The Philippines [PH] | 10,000 PHP | No |
| Poland [PL] | 150 EUR | 19% |
| Australia [AU] | 1,000 AUD | No |
| Viet Nam [VN] | 1,000,000 VND | No |
| Mexico [MX] | 980 MXN | No |

## Secondhand Seller Questions
For a collection of some sites, check out the [fumo buying page](/posts/buying/).

### What is a good price for this fumo?
This will change extremely frequently as Gift and Amiami sell new releases but we can offer some rule of thumbs:
- If it's a recent (< 1 year) release on Amiami, anything above 80 USD will be entering scalping territory
- Before that, it's extremely dependent on the plush in question and the quality of the listing, but <30 USD has high potential to be a scam

### How do some sites grade their secondhand goods?
Lorem ipsum about which do and links to how if they do

### How do I find good deals?
lorem ipsum gamba

## Amiami-specific Questions

### Will Amiami ship to me?
You can check on [their chart](https://support.amiami.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048840471-Available-Shipping-method-table-by-country) if your country is listed.

### How much will shipping cost me?
During purchase of a pre-order item, you will not know until you get invoiced for the item(s). However, [Amiami states](https://support.amiami.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032895231-How-to-Obtain-a-Shipping-Estimate) you can submit comparable items to determine a shipping estimate. You can do that by [submitting a request](https://support.amiami.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and finding similar items. 

For your ease of use, here are some common plushes you might want links for estimating a shipment payment:
- [Normal Size Joon](https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=GOODS-04270994)
- [Medium Size Yuyuko (Mannaka)](https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=GOODS-04347183)
- [Large Size Yuyuko (Deka)](https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=GOODS-04257769) (of note, Dekas cannot be combined with other packages)

### How do I downsize my package?
A: go to Amiami’s homepage and select “Contact Us”. [Submit a request](https://support.amiami.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your order number and ask them if you can have your items put into a smaller box. 

### Why did this limited stock suddenly pop up on amiami and go away within seconds?
The Fumo server has a janky bot that collect Amiami listings and alerts us if it senses a stock change. Sometimes Amiami will get some random set in stock, like if someone cancels a pre-order, they might put it up for sale. These events happen at a completely random time, for a completely random selection of plushes, with a completely random amount of stock. All that to say, we don't know when it happens.

## Fumo Server-specific Questions
### How I order from sites in #buying-chat?
Refer to the [fumo buying page](/posts/buying/) for what different sites will allow.

## Reitaisai + Gift questions

### What Fumos are official?
For **official** fumos, you can see Gift's archive of their [Touhou plushes](https://www.gift-gift.jp/nui/toho.html), and their [general plush lines](https://www.gift-gift.jp/nui/). For a wider list of plushes, you are encouraged to used [MyFigureCollection](https://myfigurecollection.net/) since it has a much larger collection from various creators. If a plush isn't listed on these sites, there's a chance for it to be a custom created plush by a fan, or a bootleg company that's shifting designs.

### How often do fumos get announced or released?
lorem ipsum about twice a year and then good luck

### When will a fumo of this character be on sale?
Gamba
put deka, mannaka and regular here?

### Where can I find Gift Closet items?
link to gift closet archive, yoshida server pin, and mention other notable ones like uchi noko
