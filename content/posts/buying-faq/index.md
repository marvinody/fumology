## General Buying Questions

### Difference between a proxy and a forwarder?
Both of these options offer the same end result, buying a (normally) Japanese product and getting it imported into your country. The process of "who buys the thing" is the largest difference and is explained for each below.
#### Proxy
A proxy is a simpler experience, usually at a slight increased cost. You find a Japanese product you would like to purchase, you send them the link and the money through some form on their site, and either automatically through a bot, or manually by a human, the item will get bought and sent to their warehouse. They'll keep you updated during the process and tell you once it's arrived at their warehouse. From there, you'll need to pay an additional shipping fee to get shipped internationally (and potentially customs depending on your country and value of the item). Some popular proxies have excellent support for common sites and will let you add to the proxy cart in a single click. In summary, you give them a link and money, they buy the thing on your behalf, ship to themselves, and then ship to you.
#### Forwarder
A forwarder will give you more options in terms of availability but at an increased amount of work for the user. Starting with similar scenario, you find a Japanese product you like but you proceed with making an account on that site. Having created a forwarder account, you will get a forwarding address somewhere on the site or your profile. On the purchasing site, when you go to purchase, you would use that forwarding address instead of your own. Eventually, the item will make its way to that forwarding address, at which point they will alert you. This is where proxies and forwarders are most similar since you'll have to also pay for international shipping here like a proxy. If an item is predicted to be sold out extremely quickly, this will be the preferred method since you are in control of the buying because manual proxies will tend to have a large lag on purchasing at a certain time.

### List of proxies
We mention some in the [fumo buying page](/posts/buying/#recommended-proxies) but that's not an exhaustive list.

### What is Suruga-ya, Lashinbang, Mercari, etc
We mention the well-known ones in the [fumo buying page](/posts/buying/#secondhand--bootleg-fumo-sellers).

### What are my different shipping options?
You'll hear these options when shipping packages:

| Shipping Method | Rough Time Estimate | Always has tracking? |
| ----- | --- | ----- |
| EMS | 1-3 weeks | Yes
| DHL | 3-10 days | Yes
| SAL | 6-13 days | Only Registered
| Air Small Packet | 2-4 weeks | Only Registered
| Air Parcel | 2-4  weeks| Yes
| Surface Parcel | 2-4 months | Yes (but sometimes doesn't update)
| Surface Mail | 2-4 months | Yes (but sometimes doesn't update)

Prices will vary wildly depending on location, package size and/or weight. Different services have different methods to determine shipping and the best way to estimate shipping is to get a quote if you can. The second best way is finding a similarly-shipped package. If you ever plan on asking, you should include at least these 3 pieces of information: from where, to where, and what. 

If you need extended summaries, you can view several better resources like [Japan Post](https://www.post.japanpost.jp/int/service/dispatch/index_en.html), [Hobby Link Japan](https://support.hlj.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001861474-Shipping-Methods-Overview), or even [Amiami](https://support.amiami.com/hc/en-us/articles/13770040744345-Shipping-Service-Comparison). An important note is that not all shipping services may give you a tracking number, and a tracking number is almost always good for your sanity if you're inexperienced in buying overseas. Confirm that the method does have a tracking number or is "Registered" which implies package tracking. Normally you can find this on the site that will ultimately ship to you. [HLJ](https://www.hlj.com/shipping-from-hobbylink-japan/) and [Amiami](https://support.amiami.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048840471-Available-Shipping-method-table-by-country) both let you check available methods for your destination country.

### What is VAT or Customs Tax?
Slightly different things but both are extra fees you may have to pay on your packages, or your country will be angry at you.
Outside the EU, VAT isn't something to worry about, but for our EU friends you'll have to pay about 19% VAT (and sometimes an additional flat fee to the delivery company).

Customs/duties tax is for any country that you're importing a product from outside the country. This will vary wildly, and most countries have a minimum limit before having this applied, so this may not count for you. Most will also have different rates but the important question is at what price point do you generally have to consider paying these fees?

Below is a table for some common countries for your reference, note this may be outdated [Last updated 2024-03-21]

The minimum values for customs have been pulled from [Global Express](https://global-express.org/index.php?id=271&act=101&profile_id=-1&countries%5B%5D=-2&search_terms=&question-filter=&qid_34=1&qid_34_optid=1&qid_35=1&qid_36=1&qid_92=1). Customs & Duties are used interchangeably below but they're technically different. If you need a more exact number, look up your country's information.

| Country | Customs (starting value) | VAT |
| ---------------------- | ------- | --- |
| United States [US] | 800 USD | No |
| Germany [DE] | 150 EUR | 19%, 6-16 EUR to delivery company |
| France [FR] | 150 EUR | 19% |
| Canada [CA] | 20 CAD | No |
| United Kingdom [UK] | 135 GBP | No |
| The Philippines [PH] | 10,000 PHP | No |
| Poland [PL] | 150 EUR | 19% |
| Australia [AU] | 1,000 AUD | No |
| Viet Nam [VN] | 1,000,000 VND | No |
| Mexico [MX] | 980 MXN | No |
| Singapore [SG] | 400 SGD | 9% GST |

### How do I avoid VAT or Customs Tax?
This is illegal to do and you definitely shouldn't do it. You might hear that some proxies or forwarders let you undervalue the item or mark it as a gift to pay less fees. You definitely should avoid doing this because you are robbing your country from needed taxes they collect. If your package is undervalued, gets lost, and you need to file a claim, you can only recover up to the value of the declared package, not the original amount you paid for.

### What is a Sniper Bid and how do Bids work on Buyee?
Sniping is a broad term for sneaking in at the last few minutes during an auction and placing a higher bid. This, in the past, would result in in a higher chance to win the bid since you would catch the other bidders off-guard with a last-minute increase. In modern days, most auction sites have "anti-sniping" built in which means if you place a bid in the last few minutes, the auction timer will reset to 15 minutes to give people a chance to react. Buyee has a sniping feature built in which you can give it a number and when the auction is nearly over, Buyee will apply the smallest amount of your number to give you the winning bid. This can happen a few times if someone else is bidding against you. 

Sample scenario: You are bidder A, all other letters are other bidders. An item is listed at 1,000 JPY, you have a sniper bid set for 10,000 JPY. B currently has the current winning bid (and has a max bid of 5,000 JPY).
1. C bids for 3000 JPY
2. B's max bid immediately overtakes it and still is winning at 3,100 JPY
3. C places a new bid for 5,500 JPY (max)
4. B and C's bids automatically go back and forth until it reaches 5,100 JPY with C as the current winner
5. In the last few minutes, your sniper bid triggers and bids at 5,200 JPY
6. C's bid and your sniper bid go back and forth until it reaches 5,600 JPY, with you as the current winner
7. No one else places another bid and you win with 5,600 JPY (even though you had a max of 10,000)!

When using Buyee, it's helpful to see your bid as "the maximum amount you're ok with paying for this item." Buyee will try to pay the lowest amount possible by not overbidding over another user in large jumps. Just set an amount you're comfortable with and don't get too emotionally attached to a listing, lest you suffer [calor licitantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calor_licitantis) and end up over paying. 

It should also be mentioned that if you *are* invested in buying an item, do not mention what item you are bidding on, or how much you are bidding in a public space. People can and will mess with you if they are cruel and either raise the item's price or just place a sniper bid outside your range. The time for celebration is when you get the winning email notification.

## Secondhand Seller Questions
For a collection of some sites, check out the [fumo buying page](/posts/buying/).

### What is a good price for this fumo?
This will change extremely frequently as Gift and Amiami sell new releases, but we can offer some rule of thumbs:
- If it's a recent (< 1 year) release on Amiami, anything above 80 USD will be entering scalping territory.
- Before that, it's extremely dependent on the plush in question and the quality of the listing, but <30 USD has high potential to be a scam.

### How do some sites grade their secondhand goods?
It will depend on site to site, but here's a quick rundown for some common ones.
#### Amiami Grading
All items are new unless you see a pre-owned tag on it. The title will contain something like `(Pre-owned ITEM:A/BOX:B)` which indicate the condition of each piece. In the item page, if you scroll down, you will be able to see what each letter stands for in terms of quality so you can make an informed decision. Amiami tends to not give details for poor quality items, even if you open a ticket, as stated in [their FAQ](https://support.amiami.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016218092-Why-was-this-item-given-a-certain-condition-rating).

#### YAJ / Buyee Grading
This is a bit of a grab bag in terms of condition because listings are created by individuals and not a company. Think more like eBay where anyone can create a listing. Keep your eyes open for stock images, and poor seller ratings to avoid a scam or potential issues. Most sellers will list obvious dirt or damage in the description and include close up images if there's anything noticeable. Take care on impulse buying if you see a good deal and scout it out first. Since anyone can put up an item, there is a chance for the seller to lie about the item, so this is why you need to check the ratings and see for custom images. You want to avoid as many red flags as possible.

#### Suruga-Ya Grading
As mentioned in the Buying page, Suruga-Ya is a reseller that takes items in and is centralized, making it more like a thrift shop instead of a flea market. As stated from [their FAQ](https://www.suruga-ya.jp/man/customer_guide/used_item_policy.html), "if we need to notify you of the condition of a product, we will clearly state the details before selling the product." So clearly read the item's page & check images, if supplied, to see the condition of the item. There's not much worry for them to lie to you here, but sometimes the images aren't the best. Make sure you run the page through a translator if you don't speak Japanese. Normally, there will just be some slight discoloration on older plushes. 

#### Mercari Grading
Mercari is similar to YAJ where individual users list their items, meaning it's ripe for potential lies. Again, make sure to look at the images to be non-stock, and at the seller reviews to confirm trustworthiness of the seller. By default, Mercari JP has 6 basic "usage statuses" for the items listed on [their FAQ](https://help.jp.mercari.com/guide/articles/62/), ranging from new, to no noticeable stains, to poor condition and a few more in between. They even specify "The 'product condition' you set is just a guideline." Pay extra attention to condition if it looks like a good deal. Traditionally, this has been an amazing site to find rare finds but scalpers have started moving their gazes to here and are quick to pull the trigger, so you will need to check regularly if you want to find anything good nowadays.

#### Lashinbang Grading
Lashinbang is another centralized seller that grades items according to their standard before listing them. According to [their FAQ](https://shop.lashinbang.com/user_data/faq), they use a much simpler 3 status option of Unopened, A (normal, maybe slight scratches/stains), and B (definitely scratches/stains). Similar to Amiami, they won't respond for further detail if you have questions about an item, stating "We cannot respond to inquiries regarding product specifications." This can be a good site to find older Gift designs, but it's rare to find a good deal for anything new.

#### Mandarake Grading
Mandarake is yet another centralized seller that grades items when receiving them. [Their FAQ](https://earth.mandarake.co.jp/help/en/faq/faq-en.html) states that the majority of their stock is second-hand, but once they receive an item, they check it and note any damage on the page, with the exception of any age-related damage. They also will not grade unopened items besides labeling it as unopened.


### How do I find good deals?
Time is the main factor here. A suggestion is to have searches for whichever plushes or items you want, bookmark all of them and store them in a bookmark folder. Then you should be able to right-click "open all bookmarks" for that folder to quickly scan all your relevant pages & queries. You will also need consistency to do this often enough to spot a good deal, and a bit of luck. Another tip is to sort the pages by "most recently updated" before bookmarking so you'll always see the latest items at the top and have less searching to do. If you need help navigating the Japanese UI, just ask for help in the server in one of the channels.

## Amiami-specific Questions

### What is the relationship between Gift and Amiami? 
Gift makes the plushs. Amiami ships them (now). 

Amiami used to ship them in the past (pre-2017), and then Gift decided to handle shopping on their Giftshop page (2017-2021). They moved back to Amiami in 2021.

### Will Amiami ship to me?
You can check on [their chart](https://support.amiami.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048840471-Available-Shipping-method-table-by-country) if your country is listed.

### How much will shipping cost me?
During purchase of a pre-order item, you will not know until you get invoiced for the item(s). However, [Amiami states](https://support.amiami.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032895231-How-to-Obtain-a-Shipping-Estimate) that you can submit comparable items to determine a shipping estimate. You can do that by [submitting a request](https://support.amiami.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and finding similar items. 

For your ease of use, here are some links to common plushes for estimating a shipment payment:
- [Normal Size Joon](https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=GOODS-04270994)
- [Medium Size Yuyuko (Mannaka)](https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=GOODS-04347183)
- [Large Size Yuyuko (Deka)](https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=GOODS-04257769) (of note, Dekas cannot be combined with other packages)

### How do I downsize my package?
Go to Amiami’s homepage and select “Contact Us”. [Submit a request](https://support.amiami.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your order number and ask them if you can have your items put into a smaller box. 

### Why did this limited stock suddenly pop up on Amiami and go away within seconds?
The Fumo server has a janky bot that collect Amiami listings and alerts us if it senses a stock change. Sometimes Amiami will get an item randomly set in-stock. For example, when someone cancels a pre-order, Amiami might put it back up for sale. These events happen at a completely random time, for a completely random selection of plushes, with a completely random amount of stock. All that to say, we don't know when it happens.

## Fumo Server-specific Questions
### How I order from sites in #buying-chat?
Refer to the [fumo buying page](/posts/buying/) for what different sites will allow.

## Reitaisai + Gift questions

### What fumos are official?
For **official** fumos, you can see Gift's archive of their [Touhou plushes](https://www.gift-gift.jp/nui/toho.html), and their [general plush lines](https://www.gift-gift.jp/nui/). For a wider list of plushes, you are encouraged to used [MyFigureCollection](https://myfigurecollection.net/) since it has a much larger collection from various creators. If a plush isn't listed on these sites, there's a chance for it to be a custom created plush by a fan, or a bootleg company that's shifting designs.

### How often do fumos get announced or released?
New fumos are generally announced twice a year at Reitaisai. After that, it takes an indeterminant amount of time to be actually available to be purchased on Amiami, and further time to be shipped out. Good luck!

### What is Reitaisai?
Think Comicon but for Touhou. It happens twice a year in Spring & Autumn, and the [Touhou Wiki](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Reitaisai) has a collection

### When will a fumo of this character be on sale?
For regular fumos:
If you're a fan of EoSD, it will likely go on sale within one year along with a different colored version of her.
If you're after other regular fumos, it might take a year or two. There are no guarantees (not even the previous quip about EoSD recolors is a guarantee).
Keep an eye on overstocks, you may be pleasantly surprised.

For mannakas and dekas:
Anywhere between now and the end of time. Do note that while mannaka sales work like regular fumos but rarer, dekas, when they arrive, are limited sale and have not been made-to-order so you must be extremely quick when purchasing.

### Where can I find Gift Closet items?
You can see all the official Gift Closet items on [Gift's page](https://www.gift-gift.jp/nuigurumi_costume/). Note that there are two sizes, one for 20cm and one for 15cm (at the bottom, noted by a small strap near the head icon). Here's a [Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/257310633211461633/747625026806743072/1173768471834800198) with several links to Suruga-Ya searches to help finding them. The message includes a brand called UCHI NOCO which is unrelated to Gift and makes other smaller sized outfits that you may like. Sometimes just searching "Gift Closet" is enough to get you decent results on most Japanese sites.
