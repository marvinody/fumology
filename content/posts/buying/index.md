## Official Fumo Sellers
### [Amiami](https://www.amiami.com/eng/) [Global except Japan] ✅
The only legit place you can buy fumos for retail price consistently. Sales are generally made to order from now meaning you shouldn't miss any sale as long as you're aware of the order windows. They ship globally to most countries which you can check [here](https://support.amiami.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048840471-Available-Shipping-method-table-by-country).

### [Amiami JP](https://www.amiami.jp/) [Japan Only] ✅ ⚠️
Also the other legit place to get fumos from but they will only sell to Japanese addresses and is difficult to purchase through a proxy or forwarder. Under most circumstances, people will not need to interact with this since the above one is global and has exact same sales.

### [Amiami Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_dkr=1&iconV2Request=true&_blrs=recall_filtering&_ssn=amiami_com&store_cat=0&store_name=amiamijapan&_oac=1&_nkw=fumofumo%20touhou) [US Only] ✅
A small selection but you can sometimes find the one you're looking for here. Please note that this is **US ONLY** and is slightly more expensive than Amiami's official page.


## Secondhand & Bootleg Fumo Sellers
Now we move on to a much larger branch of sites, where prices can range from a great bargain to a scam, and the state of the item can be brand new, to 10 years old. It is up to you to determine if both parts of the equation are suitable for you. If you need help, feel free to ask in the help channels. By definition, secondhand items are **not new items**. Please read listings carefully and look at images to determine the condition of the item you're purchasing and make sure you're comfortable with any damage on the items.

### [Yahoo Auction Japan](https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/) [Japan Only] ✅❌⚠️
Japanese auction site where people can put up listings for secondhand items. Fumos tend to show up here quite often. Just be aware of things such as sniper bids (bids that are placed on listings during the last 5 minutes) or if the listing mentions any specific shipping fees. Some listings have a "buy out price", which means if someone pays that amount, they immediately win. Sometimes, it may be worth paying the buyout if it's an item you don't want to risk losing by leaving it up to an auction but it will vary by item and by person.

### [Suruga-ya](https://www.suruga-ya.jp/) [Japan Only] ✅⚠️🛑
Secondhand hobby store that sells used goods given to them from people in Japan. They mainly use stock images for their listings so be sure to read the product condition notes carefully. Refrain from buying here if nervous.

### [Lashinbang](https://shop.lashinbang.com/) [Japan Only] ✅⚠️🛑
Secondhand hobby store that sells used goods given to them from people in Japan. They mainly use stock images for their listings so be sure to read the product condition notes carefully. Refrain from buying here if nervous.

### [Mercari Japan](https://jp.mercari.com/) [Japan Only] ✅❌⚠️
Secondhand hobby website that allows people in Japan to list items they own. Fumos appear here often. Be sure to read the product descriptions carefully and analyze the product photos provided. It’s recommended that you use Google’s image search option to check and see if the seller actually took the pictures they provided.

### [Mercari](https://www.mercari.com/) [US Only] ✅❌
Secondhand hobby website that allows people in the US to list items they own. Fumos appear here much less frequently than on the Japanese variant. Be sure to read the product descriptions carefully and analyze the product photos provided. It’s recommended that you use Google’s image search option to check and see if the seller actually took the pictures they provided.

### [Youkai Mountain](https://youkaimountain.com/) [Global] ✅🛑💸
YoukaiMountain is a relatively new reseller based in the US. While they sell legitimate fumos that are brand new, their prices are 3 times that of retail value (120 dollars for a fumo, 240 for a medium/mannaka fumo). There's not necessarily anything wrong with this, however it’s usually advised to look at other secondhand websites first to see if you can find a better deal. This site is more of a last resort.

### [FumoXFumo](https://fumoxfumo.aliexpress.com/store/1102007008) [Global] ❌🛑
FumoXFumo is a shop on aliexpress that sells bootleg fumos for around 40 USD. Bootlegs are OK to share on this server, but we do make an active attempt to let people know when merch is not official by Gift. **They are not the manufacturers and drop ship the items to you for an extra cost.**

### [LolitaCos](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1101429881) [Global] ❌🛑
LolitaCos is another shop on aliexpress that sells bootlegs but also several other plushes & items. **They are not the manufacturers and drop ship the items to you for an extra cost.**

## Scammers
