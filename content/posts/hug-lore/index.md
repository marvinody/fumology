[@Yuyuko_Saigyoji](https://twitter.com/Yuyuko_Saigyoji) went to Japan (for Comiket?) and brought a Youmu and Yuyuko fumo. After some events they misplaced the Yuyuko and didn't realize until after New Year's and didn't have time to retrace their steps.

[@zerokonbu](https://twitter.com/zerokonbu2) started tracing steps to see if he could find the lost Yuyuko.

He was able to find her still at the restaurant!

Unfortunately, @Yuyuko_Saigyoji had to leave before they could meet up and get the Yuyuko back. Youmu was flying solo...

Yuyuko got to spend some extra time in Japan with zero and a whole different set of fumos.

A week later, they were re-united!
