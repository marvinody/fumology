A lot of this detail will have bene lifted from the #custom-fumo-hub on the [discord](https://discord.gg/fumofumo) so if you have any questions or need help, there's lots of creators there who can try to help you in making a soft new friend.

Credit is attempted to be given when possible, but let us know if we made a mistake and we'll update it.

## Can't make a plush? Commission one!

We have a couple of channels for custom makers to post when they're opening commissions to create new plushes or when they're trying to sell already made ones! If you join the [server](https://discord.gg/fumofumo), make sure to pick up the correct role so you won't miss an update. You can also "follow" the channel to get notifications in your own server.
