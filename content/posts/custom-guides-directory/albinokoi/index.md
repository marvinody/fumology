## Deconstructing + Reverse Enginerring a plush

Use a thread clipper or a seam ripper for it! Be careful as to not cut the fabric in the process. 

Before doing the deconstruction, take pictures of the "patient" in all sides. You will use these when you try to piece them together again in pattern form.

Be mindful of how big their seam allowance is (it's the distance of their sewing to the edge) since you can trace the piece wholly or cut away the seam allowance so you can get the exact piece and add your desired seam allowance later on.

Try to label each individual piece while doing this as to not get lost which piece goes where.

Additional documentation would be recording your deconstruction process so you know how it was pieced together. Sewing in order means a lot specially in plush toys.

Lastly, enjoy the process as always!
