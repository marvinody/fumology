## Materials to use for Fumo Making

### Base (from-scratch only): 
When making a base, you'll need toyknit, a material which doesn't fray or pill. You can find it on sites like aliexpress marketed as "doll skin fabric" and such. You'll need skin color, white (for the underwear) and any shoe color(s). Popular sellers are [ibotti](https://aliexpress.com/item/32603856876.html) for skin color, you'll want to pick the option A for normal fumos; [this listing](https://aliexpress.com/item/32710927906.html) for other colors and [hopen textiles](https://aliexpress.com/item/32909551665.html) (a bit more expensive, but has many more colors than the 11 ibotti has to offer. You can contact the seller if you want to choose from more colors).

### Secret tip (from-scratch only): 
If you don't want (or don't have the money) to buy an embroidery machine, try looking around for shops near you that have one. There are many fabric stores/haberdasheries that embroider things for you for a fee. I don't know how they work since I bought a machine before trying any, but it's worth checking out if you're just starting out. You can find the embroidery file later in the guide.

### Hair
The two most used materials are blizzard fleece and minky. Fleece has pile (hair) on both sides as opposed to minky, so it might be more difficult to work with depending on how long the pile length is. Minky tends to be more expensive, but softer and thinner. You can also go for other fleece types with bigger pile lengths if you want the Extra Fluffy™️ look. None of these are exactly what official fumos use, but they're close enough.

### Clothes 
Official fumos use toyknit, but if you're not patient enough to wait a month for your fabric to arrive, or just want to "feel" the fabric yourself, you can visit a fabric store in your area and see what they have. You'll generally want a type of fabric that doesn't pill and doesn't fray (which means if you cut it it doesn't have "threads" coming out of it).


## Bangs
For "basic bangs" I just follow this process. Start out with a rectangle and then cut it like this. The green angle must be not quite 90° but something similar.

## Fumo Face Embroidery Files
This [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1exl7wEMbJw8HLrW5dyUkiNPQAVIBIgc6) contains a decent selection of fumo faces to choose from if you don't have a good embroidery software to make your own faces with. They are far from perfect, and I do find myself tweaking them a little every once in a while, they're a starter point if you're new to embroidery software or don't have any.

The faces I shared are (click on image to download .pes file):
{{< figure src="./1-happy-by-n0re-preview.png" link="./1-happy-by-n0re.pes" title="① Happy (Yuyuko, Yukari) (made by n0re)">}}
{{< figure src="./2-happy-eyelashes-preview.png" link="./2-happy-eyelashes.pes" title="② Happy with eyelashes (Kaguya)">}}
{{< figure src="./3-relaxed-preview.png" link="./3-relaxed.pes" title="③ Relaxed (Aya)">}}
{{< figure src="./4-relaxed-eyelashes-preview.png" link="./4-relaxed-eyelashes.pes" title="④ Relaxed with eyelashes (Yuuka)">}}
{{< figure src="./5-flan-yuugi-preview.png" link="./5-flan-yuugi.pes" title="⑤ Flandre (Yuugi)">}}
{{< figure src="./6-unamused-preview.png" link="./6-unamused.pes" title="⑥ Unamused (Reimu)">}}
{{< figure src="./7-frown-preview.png" link="./7-frown.pes" title="⑦ Frowning (Mokou)">}}
{{< figure src="./8-pout-preview.png" link="./8-pout.pes" title="⑧ Pouting (Patchouli)">}}
{{< figure src="./9-cirnu-but-slightly-less-smug-preview.png" link="./9-cirnu-but-slightly-less-smug.pes" title="⑨ Cirno but a bit less smug">}}

Remember that, even if you don't have an embroidery machine, you can still look for fabric stores/haberdashieries near you that have one. They could embroider a face for you for a couple of bucks!

Here's a real life image of some of the above faces (might need to open in new tab)
