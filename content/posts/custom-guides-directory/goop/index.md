## Material List

### Official
- Skin - clothes: toyknit
- Hair: velboa/soft boa + toyknit held together with fusing interfacing
- Clothes: toyknit, Occasionally toyknit with a texture applied by sublimation printing
- Frills: just regular ribbon, the same you can get in any sewing shop or online
- Accessories/wings: felt
- Details: vinyl

### Customs:
- Skin: Toyknit or anything close enough
- Clothes: literally any fabric as long as it's convenient
- Hair: felt or minky (I personally use Minky+toyknit fused together, but I recommend  Minky, as soft boa isn't exactly available)
- Details: embroidery or vinyl
- Accessories: generally felt, but anything works really

## Leg Guide

1. Sew the bottom parts together by the side, do not sew the thigh gap nor the back. In parallel, sew the shoe top to the leg

2. Sew the bottom of the foot to the leg ensembles, but do not sew the legs as cylinders yet.

3. Sew the top of the legs to the bottom ensembles. Be careful, this part is quite technical and mistakes can come easily.

4. Now you have to close the legs from the bottom foot to the thigh gap, preferably with one strong seam for each leg. Be careful to end both of the seams symmetrically in the middle of the bottom front part.

5. Now you have to close the bottom and the back of the bottom ensemble, starting from the middle of the thigh gap.

6. you can finish the bottom part by sewing the dart on both of the pieces symmetrically.
