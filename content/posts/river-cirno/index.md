A short story with a happy ending!

[@Maniac9292](https://twitter.com/Maniac9292) was trying to take a picture with his Cirno Fumo around a river. The wind took up and she ended up falling down into the river.

Someone from the group recorded her floating downstream

Soon after, she got a nice cleaning and drying.

She got treated to a nice snack afterwards too.

And then some Aya slander for causing him so much grief.
