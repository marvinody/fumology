## Overview

This is going to be a tough one to make a writeup for.

I'm unsure where to start to make this entertaining for readers, but it's not really something to take lightly so I think a long-form approach is warranted here to provide as much context as I can bother to include. 

To summarize so people have a quick clue if they don't know, a long time & well integrated member had come to the conclusion that a moderator was retweeting underage art. They proceeded to DM several regulars with this slanderous rumor at which point, is when I became aware of his actions. Shortly after, he engaged me directly, bringing up his "evidence" against the mod. After a short discussion, I removed the user the morning after and he proceeded to have a fallout, ultimately resulting in posting to another social media and sharing his side (without DM evidence or the full story). Since he went public with his posts, I see this as completely fair game now to publish this document to show how absurd this siutation this.

In this post, we'll start from the beginning, going from his join and growth in the server and community as a whole, through him becoming "elitist" from his growth, and culminating in his fall overnight. This will be an extremely long read, so fair warning given. And if the user in question is reading this, I **URGE** you to read the whole document, even though I can already guess you won't and you'll skim and react to it. To others, I want to acknowledge that this kid is still young and I don't want to ruin his life so don't seek him out to harass him. He did a stupid thing followed by another stupid thing and this is more of an outlet for me than wanting to "cancel" him or anything of the sort. I hope he'll come to see this as a learning moment in life instead of molding his life around this turn of events.


## The Beginning

Now we'll have to jump back to the very beginning because this user was well-known in the community so these claims came as a shock. Why was he well-known? He made very cute custom fumos! And he posted nice videos and photos of them! But even before all his journey into custom making, we should address his introduction. Within minutes of his joining, he posted a picture of his newly acquired fumo, a Cirno! Another user asked how much she cost (Cirnos normally cost a lot because she's popular), and he quickly responded with 200+ USD. 

For people unaware, it's quite a lot to pay for a plush, but his reasoning was that she's regularly listed for 500 USD so it's OK. People's money is their thing and that's alright to spend it on, but the introduction is definitely an iconic moment of entering the server and broadcasting that you spent that much on a scalped plush. It might be worth noting here that this wasn't his first fumo so he was familiar with the average price being in the 40-60 USD range.

## Growth
Talk about how he made videos a lot and liked seeing people happy with them and became popular on a few groups
He definitely made use of the Cirno fumo, taking her everywhere and posting pictures with her, and I want to be abundantly clear, that is great and that's the whole point of the community. I'm not mentioning this to pick on him, just documenting the journey as a whole as best as I can recollect. He continued to post nice pictures with other fumos from his collection like Reisen (RUI), and Chen and Shion was someone that was nice to see in chat because you knew cute pictures were soon to follow. 

A few months after joining, he even started down the custom plush path and found some characters he liked and gave them a fumo form! They looked great and it was nice to see them in chat every time. He seemed to bash on some other creators and say things like "How would you rate mine compared to X person's? Their's looks...ugh" which is a red flag since people put a lot of effort into making them and it's a dick move to shit on other's work like that. I think this was the earliest point where some people saw this behavior and started reforming their opinion on him, seeing that his participation was more attention-based rather than wanting to be a part of the community.

## The Elite Custom Maker
I think the creation of his custom fumos led to an increase in posting them (just natural to want to show off your work, that's OK), which led to more attention and led to a cycle. That's not an inherently bad cycle, but here's where I'll come in with the armchair dianogsis and apply the label of narcissism. I'll cherrypick some symptoms to display and we can go into a couple of them in this section. In no particular order, numbered only to refer to them:
1. Have an unreasonably high sense of self-importance and require constant, excessive admiration.
2. Make achievements and talents seem bigger than they are.
3. Be critical of and look down on people they feel are not important.
4. React with rage or contempt and try to belittle other people to make themselves appear superior.
5. Insist on having the best of everything â€” for instance, the best car or office.

We touched on (3) and (4) a bit with him putting down other custom makers and putting his own creations on a pedestal. As an aside to spread some wisdom, the moment you stop criticizing yourself is the moment you stop improving. You always can improve or learn more and I believe one of the better reasons to find meaning in your life is to find something you like and continually improve on it and I hope everyone can find that one thing or things they can hold onto for life. Coming back to our character, I will say that (4) is not always constant with him and there are times where he compliments others and since I lack the obvious degree in Psychology, I can't give a proper diagnosis but I think it's more about categorizing problematic behavior than giving a diagnosis for someone to identify and improve themselves. I don't think it's that simple as saying one compliment to a user undoes how he views his own creation of one character to another creator's design take on that character. But it's definitely worth stating that the compliments did happen occasionally.

Now, why do I put (1) as a cherrypicked sample? To address the elephant in the room about a community that is centered around posting pictures and having others enjoy them, yes, everyone who posts pictures generally wants others to see them. It's hard to quantify exactly how you can tell when a user is looking for attention according to a rubric and score X amount of points for a single message. But when someone says things like "stop giving me attention," they're generally looking for attention. People who wouldn't want it, either wouldn't post in the first place or would just step away. The ones who keep going at it are almost certainly doing it, if not fully, then at least partially for the attention. Again, that's not inherently bad since the community revolves around people posting pictures and getting reactions or seeing others happy about their pictures. I'm not saying he's evil because he likes seeing people react to his pictures. I feel like I have to state this because if I don't, I'll get blamed for being ambiguous and I want to ensure that it can't be taken in a manner otherwise.

One of the other tendencies that popped up towards the end of his membership was this idea that Gift (the company that produces fumos) is ruining fumos by making more because "it is just them putting out too much." He didn't really go too into depth on why this made him upset but that he felt the quality had declined (which isn't true besides design changes). But he's not against the characters in specific, simply the amount of them now available and the consequences of that. Making them more accessible to more people means they're not as rare or limited quantity and remember that this is the individual who spent over 200 on a Cirno plush. That touches a little on (5), but the one that really supports it is how he would put his own customs against the upcoming releases and say things like "that doesn't look right" and "that character is lacking." In his defense, he did state that he would buy some anyway, but it's still this idea of, "mine better, company now bad" that he tried pushing. I do agree that Gift takes shortcuts in some designs (Gift, where are Suika's horn?), but they can't put the detail that custom makers who charge 4-8x the price of a regular fumo do. It's an unreasonable standard to hold them up to and he, at the same time, says that's not the problem and then complains about it. So is their design the issue, or is the quantity the issue? I think we're complaining for the sake of complaining.

# Fumogram

Hey, let's take a hop over to his other social media, Instagram. This will come up later so we might as well mention it now. He had created an Instagram (IG) account, posted images to it, and gained a nice following. At some point, some fellow started leaving weird comments on his posts. The only reason this is of note is because he would complain consistently in the discord server about this one user and the comments left. Countless times, he was told to block and ignore the indiviual and to not bring him up in the server. And countless times, he ignored those suggestions and continued to complain about the user. At some point, he stated that the IG user was also defaming him and spouting false statements to ruin his credibility (we call this foreshadowing). Now, I'll admit to not having any firsthand evidence of either the comments, or the alleged defamatory posts. Speaking with a fuller hand than at the time this was going on, I believe we're dealing with an unreliable narrator and I'm not sure how much we can confide that his posts were unbiased and telling the truth.

But what I do have, are posts of his public messages in the server that we can refer back to to get an idea of this individual.

{{< figure src="images/messages/Screenshot_2023-09-08_at_19_19_41.png" target="_blank" caption="What we call foreshadowing">}}

{{< figure src="images/messages/Screenshot_2023-09-08_at_19_26_13.png" target="_blank" caption="Understandable, being worried about someone online ruining your reputation with a fake story">}}

I'll address the significance of figure 1 a bit later, so let's look at figure 2 now. Being worried about that is completely understandable and is a shitty thing for the person to do (I'm assuming this whole ordeal **did** happen) and the reaction is somewhat justified. What I think is over the top is how much it was brought up and the same response was given in the server with how little control we have of the situation. If this person was a user in the server and they were spreading this, they would be removed if they were truly spreading it. It's been done in the past and I'm sure it'll be done in the future. But we have zero control of IG accounts and complaining in public repeatedly is pointless and comes off as attention seeking at worst, after all the useful advice has been expensed and ignored.

There were other instances of him bringing up users from IG in the server for whatever reasons he was against them and perhaps they were warranted or maybe not, it was certainly not a one-off case. 

## The Beginning of the End

Back to the server! I'll preface the following by saying that I do read a large portion of the messages in the server even if I don't react or reply to them and I don't think that should come as a surprise to most people. I mention that because you tend to realize that people express certain behaviors and you know when someone is going through something if they're not themselves in chat or if they're asking something weird. One day, he asked a regular in chat "hey, can I DM you?" Perfectly reasonable and not my business, sometimes you want to move the conversation to a private one. The weird part is where he goes "I'm gonna send you a controversial opinion to you in DMs" followed by "I saw things I wish not to see" and then followed by "I'm on the verge of leaving." It raises some eyebrows when you announce stuff like that in a public server.

It raises more eyebrows when several people get pinged and asked "hey can I DM you" in a public server by the same person. Clearly, something is wrong if he's reaching out to regulars and he is stating he "feels sick" in public. At this point, I can't do much besides DMing him myself but it's not drama I want to willingly go seek. Unforunately, it has a a history of always making its way back to me.

## Confrontation
All of the following conversations are from his DMs with me. Also below, **you'll see some images of some rather large women which you may want to avoid if that sort of art makes you uncomfortable.**

{{< figure src="images/messages/Screenshot_2023-09-09_at_15_05_15.png" target="_blank" caption="First DM from him">}}

(I've omitted my initial response which is that I was in game and might need time before immediately responding)

Well, that's definitely quite the claim he's made. I hope he has enough evidence to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, since according to figure 1, he has issues when others accuse him and degrade his image. At this point, it's obvious that the people he was DMing in the past week must have been related to this accusation. So whoever those people were, now they presumably have a warped depiction of this user from his actions.

{{< figure src="images/messages/Screenshot_2023-09-09_at_15_14_09.png" target="_blank" caption="The second omission is a personal detail he shared that I didn't want to reveal">}}

The person in question does have a NSFW twitter, and takes commissions, and in their own words, "i, an adult, make art featuring adults, for adults." I can't say too much on this "easily gained access" part since I believe most of the posts show up as content warning (and require an additional click to view), but the two accounts are named similarly, I'm aware of that aspect. However, he's never posted any of his NSFW art on this server.

{{< figure src="images/messages/Screenshot 2023-09-09 at 15.28.54.png" target="_blank" caption="Image that was retweeted and is his sole piece of evidence for the claim">}}

Definitely large. I'll come back to the actual art in the section after this.

{{< figure src="images/messages/Screenshot 2023-09-09 at 15.30.32.png" target="_blank" caption="Just to get my view">}}

I don't think it's "mainly filled" since those people tend to get removed quickly for being obnoxious or having bad takes, but there are a few members under 18 in the server that have stayed. I'm not sure why he thinks it was so easy to find, the mod does not have his twitters linked in his bio or status, hasn't posted his twitters in our art channel for some time (over 8 months at the time of writing), and doesn't really broadcast his NSFW stuff in the server. It took him nearly a year to find out, being active in the server but if "1 year active" means "easy to find," then I guess I'm working with a different definition. 

Part of the confusion may be because the mod changed his twitter handle recently so if someone was stalking the mod and looked up old posts, then one might come across the NSFW one after the change. But surely he wouldn't have any reason to do that unless either he knew what he was looking for or he wanted to dig up something to start issues over because clicking on the old tweets will still link to the SFW account.

{{< figure src="images/messages/Screenshot_2023-09-09_at_15_44_00.png" target="_blank" caption="Omitted (besides the person) are 3 people he mentioned">}}

You can see that my initial response was disbelief, to the point that he might have linked the wrong piece of evidence. He quickly clarifies that is the correct image and that he had several people tell him that the character looked underage. For reference as to how many people he reached out, my count is nine people (known from how he would clearly declare his intention to DM people in public and give me an easy way to track). Well, nine people that I'm aware of, but potentially more. All, except one, members of the server and regular contributors to chat. Do we share this with nine people before reaching me or another moderator to take action? I suspect that this was mainly just for gossip reasons to slander the mod as opposed to being unsure.

I'm omitting two messages, one where he says another user doesn't want to be included because of the nature of the art, and another message saying he didn't want to mention other friends (aside from the ones I've omitted) because they're his friends and he would feel bad bringing them in, "in case of bias."

{{< figure src="images/messages/Screenshot_2023-09-09_at_16_47_32.png" target="_blank" caption="">}}

Let's cherrypick the important points in the rules:
- "no minors"
- "these [rules] are non-negotiable"
- "no minors"
- "if a drawing you want to post doesn't have very clearly adult proportions, please don't post it"

Three times, the mod states, in his own personal server, that underage posting is not allowed, with an additional point being made to not try to get around it. Like I said in my message to him, I'm not sure how much clearer the rules could be on those points. And I'll make a point to stress that this whole argument is because he mistook one picture as underage. The mod has no history of this, or of liking these posts, or of anything remotely close to this but he took this one image and ran with it.

I'm still unsure of how "easy to get access to" the account is, but I've addressed that above and won't do it again. As for the uncomfortable part, I understand people having an initial moment of shock at finding out about the "post fatties" side of the mod (which is what I think he was talking about in the beginning of the end). He had a bit of an overreaction I think, but I can understand some sort of reaction, it's unusual, but everyone's got their thing. If it makes you uncomfortable...then don't go looking for it and be surprised when it's surprising. He keeps it separated as much as can be reasonably asked, so I think only people who go spelunking will find that sort of stuff.

{{< figure src="images/messages/Screenshot_2023-09-09_at_16_58_21.png" target="_blank" caption="">}}

I agree with the first part, some people do enjoy things in private. That is irrelevant there's zero evidence to support the claim he started with, that this mod is a pedophile. At this junction, let's invoke Hitchens's Razor, normally used for theistic claims, "what can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence."

So then we jump to his status (which was changed at that point already) as the next reason he's a pedophile. Again, zero evidence to support the claim. I asked the mod and he confirmed he had an emote in the status, but definitely was not underage so it has zero credence for his original claim.

{{< figure src="images/messages/Screenshot_2023-09-09_at_17_17_34.png" target="_blank" caption="Omittied are the mod's name & some of his personal life details that I don't think need to be shared">}}

I asked him to DM the mod directly mainly to see what his response would be, not to actually open a dialogue there. The response was expected, not wanting to engage because of some arbitrary reason, which tells me he'd rather skirt the user and gossip and spread rumors instead.

I don't think the "how do you know he's opposed to it" warrants explaining after I showed the rules above but he was confused about how the rules showed he was against it. I'm unsure he was emotional at this point and not parsing my messages or reading comprehension issues (which is a running joke in the server before I get yelled at).

{{< figure src="images/messages/Screenshot_2023-09-09_at_17_24_47.png" target="_blank" caption="Me, failing to use Street Epistemology">}}

Trying to maintain rationality, I tried to employ something called "Street Epistemology" which if I had to summarize it is, "find out what's core to a person's beliefs by asking them questions." Essentially, I was trying to figure out 1 thing, what would convince him that he's wrong and that he's making a baseless claim? Unfortunately, you need to use this when without emotion or biases and it was becoming harder to do that from my part because it's obvious he won't budge and the mod is a friend who I don't want to see these claims made without evidence. If you're unfamiliar with Street Epistemology or the Socratic method, I highly recommend reading some online resources about it since it's really a profound way to engage with people who hold beliefs without reason.

He brings up an extremely valid point towards the end however. "See a pattern in these kinds of posts" is indeed a way to know if someone likes a certain kind of thing. So where's the list of tweets of children (which I'll make clear, the one he linked is clearly not)? I guess he couldn't find them (because they don't exist).

A bit funny is also the last point he makes about the criminal. Generally speaking, most people who are convicted have some evidence to challenge their claim of innocence. Where's the evidence, I ask you again? In an effort to defend his point, he actually defends the moderator. Let me rephrase his comment with what he know. "Imagine asking an innocent person if they committed a crime. Of course they'd say no." Well...yes, that's why you need evidence because people are innocent by default. It's absurd to think otherwise but his miopic view simply paints the mod as a criminal without solid proof, solid patterns (according to him, the ONLY way), or even hearing the mod's own defense. We'll visit the mod's defense in the next section. 

I've omitted the next message, which is me looking at some of the art on his own twitter, calling out a drawing his partner drew and saying it was young, as a point to show that baseless claims are baseless. I concede that it was wrong to bring her into the conversation but I was getting emotional at this point and one doesn't tend to make clear decisions at this stage. A few days later, I did actually go to apologize to the partner for it and they accepted it, so I think that closes out my mistake. It's not too important to mention but I think it's worth noting that it is sincere when an apology isn't asked for, but is still given. We'll come back to this (man, that's an ongoing trope in this post).

{{< figure src="images/messages/Screenshot_2023-09-09_at_18_00_08.png" target="_blank" caption="Censored image is the same one he linked above (figure 5), but close-up and with an arrow added">}}

I won't share the art I used of his partner to not bring them into it again, but according to [this source](https://www.thegamer.com/genshin-impact-every-playable-characters-age-height-birthday/), the character in question is labeled as having an age of "young." It definitely was not drawn with an "exposed genital" but the "confirmed adult" part is just false. If we're just going to lie about facts like this, I'm not sure the next message holds any weight at all.

{{< figure src="images/messages/Screenshot_2023-09-09_at_18_22_39.png" target="_blank" caption="">}}

Zero evidence of tweets from an unreliable source. This was the last message for our confrontation. I did not respond to this but it didn't warrant a response.

Let's assume that he's right. We've now moved from the original mod and instead started looking at a pattern of the art from the original artist. So go talk to the artist, instead of the mod which retweeted an adult image. No, I guess we have this grudge against the mod. At this point, I realized he was firmly set in his mind with this idea and I could not change it, even by showing that the evidence that he based his claim on was wrong.

## Mod Comments 
TODO: Not sure if expand more on this

After sharing some of the DMs with the mod in question (since he was "uncomfortable" confronting the mod himself), this was part of the public response the mod had

{{< figure src="images/messages/F5JKbGkWYAAJSmu.jpg" target="_blank" caption="Image from the mod in his response tweet">}}

"and for the sake of actually defending myself against your braindead claims: you would have to be an absolute fucking moron to interpret the character on the left as a child. given every length i go to to ensure that what i'm making and sharing is undisputedly ADULT"

## The Morning After
{{< figure src="images/messages/Screenshot 2023-09-09 at 18.35.04.png" target="_blank" caption="">}}

In case that last sentence is difficult to read, "not entertaining an appeal" means "you will not be unbanned."
