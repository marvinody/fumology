## Overview

This is going to be a tough one to make a writeup for.

I'm unsure where to start to make this entertaining for readers, but it's not really something to take lightly so I think a more surgical approach is warranted here. 

To summarize so people have a quick clue if they don't know, a long time & well integrated member had come to the conclusion that a moderator was retweeting underage art. They proceeded to DM several regulars with this slanderous rumor at which point, is when I became aware of his actions. Shortly after, he engaged me directly, bringing up his "evidence" against the mod. After a short discussion, I removed the user the morning after and he proceeded to have a fallout, ultimately resulting in posting to another social media and sharing his side (without DM evidence or the full story). Since he went public with his posts, I see this as completely fair game now to publish this document to show how absurd this siutation this.

In this post, we'll start from the beginning, going from his join and growth in the server and community as a whole, through him becoming "elitist" from his growth, and culminating in his fall overnight. This will be an extremely long read, so fair warning given. And if the user in question is reading this, I **URGE** you to read the whole document, even know I can already guess you won't and you'll skim and react to it.


## The Beginning

Now we'll have to jump back to the very beginning because this user was well-known in the community so these claims came as a shock. Why was he well-known? He made very cute custom fumos! And he posted nice videos and photos of them! But even before all his journey into custom making, we should address his introduction. Within minutes of his joining, he posted a picture of his newly acquired fumo, a Cirno! Another user asked how much she cost (Cirnos normally cost a lot because she's popular), and he quickly responded with 200+ USD. 

For people unaware, it's quite a lot to pay for a plush, but his reasoning was that she's regularly listed for 500 USD so it's OK. People's money is their thing and that's alright to spend it on, but the introduction is definitely an iconic moment of entering the server and broadcasting that you spent that much on a scalped plush. It might be worth noting here that this wasn't his first fumo so he was familiar with the average price being in the 40-60 USD range.

## Growth
Talk about how he made videos a lot and liked seeing people happy with them and became popular on a few groups
He definitely made use of the Cirno fumo, taking her everywhere and posting pictures with her, and I want to be abundantly clear, that is great and that's the whole point of the community. I'm not mentioning this to pick on him, just documenting the journey as a whole as best as I can recollect. He continued to post nice pictures with other fumos from his collection like Reisen (RUI), and Chen and Shion was someone that was nice to see in chat because you knew cute pictures were soon to follow. 

A few months after joining, he even started down the custom plush path and found some characters he liked and gave them a fumo form! They looked great and it was nice to see them in chat every time. He seemed to bash on some other creators and say things like "How would you rate mine compared to X person's? Their's looks...ugh" which is a red flag since people put a lot of effort into making them and it's a dick move to shit on other's work like that. I think this was the earliest point where some people saw this behavior and started reforming their opinion on him, seeing that his participation was more attention-based rather than wanting to be a part of the community.

## The Elite Custom Maker
I think the creation of his custom fumos led to an increase in posting them (just natural to want to show off your work, that's OK), which led to more attention and led to a cycle. That's not an inherently bad cycle, but here's where I'll come in with the armchair dianogsis and apply the label of narcissism. I'll cherrypick some symptoms to display and we can go into a couple of them in this section. In no particular order, numbered only to refer to them:
1. Have an unreasonably high sense of self-importance and require constant, excessive admiration.
2. Make achievements and talents seem bigger than they are.
3. Be critical of and look down on people they feel are not important.
4. React with rage or contempt and try to belittle other people to make themselves appear superior.
5. Insist on having the best of everything â€” for instance, the best car or office.

We touched on (3) and (4) a bit with him putting down other custom makers and putting his own creations on a pedestal. As an aside to spread some wisdom, the moment you stop criticizing yourself is the moment you stop improving. You always can improve or learn more and I believe one of the better reasons to find meaning in your life is to find something you like and continually improve on it and I hope everyone can find that one thing or things they can hold onto for life. Coming back to our character, I will say that (4) is not always constant with him and there are times where he compliments others and since I lack the obvious degree in Psychology, I can't give a proper diagnosis but I think it's more about categorizing problematic behavior than giving a diagnosis for someone to identify and improve themselves. I don't think it's that simple as saying one compliment to a user undoes how he views his own creation of one character to another creator's design take on that character. But it's definitely worth stating that the compliments did happen occasionally.

Now, why do I put (1) as a cherrypicked sample? To address the elephant in the room about a community that is centered around posting pictures and having others enjoy them, yes, everyone who posts pictures generally wants others to see them. It's hard to quantify exactly how you can tell when a user is looking for attention according to a rubric and score X amount of points for a single message. But when someone says things like "stop giving me attention," they're generally looking for attention. People who wouldn't want it, either wouldn't post in the first place or would just step away. The ones who keep going at it are almost certainly doing it, if not fully, then at least partially for the attention. Again, that's not inherently bad since the community revolves around people posting pictures and getting reactions or seeing others happy about their pictures. I'm not saying he's evil because he likes seeing people react to his pictures. I feel like I have to state this because if I don't, I'll get blamed for being ambiguous and I want to ensure that it can't be taken in a manner otherwise.
