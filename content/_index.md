Welcome to **Fumology**: A collection of fumo lore + info dumps over the years. To start reading click the posts section to see some entries.

This project was formed to be able to share some fun and sad stories over the years from the Fumo community.

Some of the posts will be a short overview with links to direct tweets or messages, so you're encouraged to visit them and "relive" the moment if possible.

This website is mainly centered around stuff that has happened in the [discord.gg/fumofumo](https://discord.gg/fumofumo) server and information that we've wanted to share with others so everyone has a public resource.
